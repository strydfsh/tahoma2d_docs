.. _using_the_version_control:

Using the Version Control System
================================
The version control system keeps in a central repository a constant history of revisions for every file in the production database.

The **central repository** must be located in a shared resource (that can be a computer in your local network or an internet-based repository), while the local copy of files, called **working copy**, at a specific time or revision, should be located on the computer you use.

When you need to work on a file, you can *get* it from the central repository to your working copy, and *edit* it; when you finish working on the file and you want to submit the changes, you can *put* it back from your working copy to the central repository. 

The file you *put* will be saved as the last revision of the file, while the previous revisions will be retained as file history, and all the users sharing the same central repository can *get* if from there. In case a previous version of the file is needed, it is always possible to retrieve it from the central repository.

Tahoma supports the **Subversion** version control system, which is one of the most popular version control systems, used in many high-scale open source projects.

.. note:: The *central repository* defined for your version control system behaves exactly as an Tahoma projectroot, therefore the project management under the version control system is the same, only referencing to the central repository instead of the projectroot (see  :ref:`Managing Projects <managing_projects>`  ).


.. _installing_the_version_control_system:

Installing the Version Control System
-------------------------------------
The version control system works as a client/server tool: the server stores all of your files in a central repository, and a client is used to *get* files to your working copy and *put* file changes to the server. 

Installing the Version Control Server 
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

It's possible to configure a computer in your local network as the version control server by installing **Subversion 1.6** or later, or it's possible to use an on-line service (e.g. Assembla).

You can go to the `Subversion starting page <http://subversion.apache.org/>`_ for downloading it.

Contact your system administrator to configure a version control server.


.. _installing_the_version_control_client_on_windows:

Installing the Version Control Client on Windows
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
On Windows the setup of a version control client requires the download and installation of the **Subversion client 1.6** or later. 

You can go to the `Subversion download page for Windows <http://subversion.apache.org/packages.html#windows>`_ for downloading it. There you should look for the available binary packages and download a version control client for Windows. We suggest the use of **CollabNet Subversion Command-Line Client**.

.. note:: If an older Subversion release is used some version control features might not work.


.. _installing_the_version_control_client_on_macintosh:

Installing the Version Control Client on Macintosh
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
On Macintosh the setup of a version control client depends on the OS version.

If the OS is Snow Leopard (version 10.6) or later, the setup requires no installation as the version control client is included in the operating system.

If the OS is *older* than Snow Leopard, the setup requires the download and installation of the **Subversion client 1.6** or later. 

You can go to the `Subversion download page for OSX <http://subversion.apache.org/packages.html#osx>`_ for downloading it. There you should look for the available binary packages and download a version control client for Macintosh.

After the installation is very important to check where Subversion is installed, as this information is needed to configure the version control in Tahoma: this information is displayed in the last page of the installation process and by default is usually ``/opt/subversion/bin`` .

.. note:: If a Subversion release older than v1.6 is used, some version control features might not work.


.. _configuring_the_version_control_in_toonz:

Configuring the Version Control in Tahoma
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Once the version control server is configured and the version control client is installed it's possible to configure Tahoma in order to use the version control.

In Tahoma the version control information is stored in the ``versioncontrol.xml``  file located in the ``Tahoma stuff\config`` folder. By default the file has the following content:

    .. code-block:: xml

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
        <Repositories>
            <!-- REMOVE ENTIRELY THIS LINE TO ENABLE SVN
        <repository>
            <name>PutYourRepositoryName</name>
            <localPath>putYourWorkingCopyPath</localPath>
            <repoPath>putYourRepositoryPath</repoPath>
        </repository>
        REMOVE ENTIRELY THIS LINE TO ENABLE SVN -->
            <svnPath></svnPath>
        </Repositories>


By editing the file with a text editor it's possible to set the information for the *central repository* and the *working copy* location.

Together with the configuration file, version control *users* must be defined by editing the ``permissions.xml``  file located in the ``Tahoma stuff\config`` folder.

.. note:: The ``versioncontrol.xml``  and ``permissions.xml``  file have to be well-formed, and so cannot contain an opening tag without its related closing tag, otherwise Tahoma will not run. If you decide to edit the files, make a backup copy first in case you need to revert the file to the original version.

.. tip:: **To configure the version control in Tahoma:**

    1. Open the ``versioncontrol.xml``  file located in the ``Tahoma stuff\config`` folder with a text editor.

    2. Delete the line
    
     ``<!-- REMOVE ENTIRELY THIS LINE TO ENABLE SVN``
     
     and the line
     
     ``REMOVE ENTIRELY THIS LINE TO ENABLE SVN -->``

    3. In the line 
    
     ``<name>PutYourRepositoryName</name>``
     
     type between the tags the name you want the repository to have in the Tahoma browser.

    4. In the line 
    
     ``<localPath>putYourWorkingCopyPath</localPath>``
     
     type between the tags the path to where you want the working copy to be located on the local computer (e.g. ``C:\myworkingcopy\``  for Windows or ``/myworkingcopy``  for Macintosh).

    5. In the line
    
     ``<repoPath>putYourRepositoryPath</repoPath>``
     
     type between the tags the URL of the central repository according to how it was defined on the version control server (e.g. ``http://10.0.0.1/mySVNrepository/``  for a repository located in the local network; ``file:///C:/mySVNrepository``  for a repository located in the local Windows computer or ``file:///mySVNrepository``  for a repository located in the local Macintosh computer; and ``https://subversion.assembla.com/svn/mySVNrepository``  for an internet-based repository).

    6. In the line 

     ``<svnPath></svnPath>``

     type between the tags the path to the folder where Subversion is installed (this information is displayed in the last page of the installation process and by default is ``/opt/subversion/bin`` ). 

    7. Save the ``versioncontrol.xml``  file.


.. tip:: **To define the version control users:**

    1. Open the ``permissions.xml``  file located in the ``Tahoma stuff\config`` folder with a text editor.

    2. In the user section define an OS user and assign their SVN user name and password as configured on the SVN server.
 
     For example to assign to the OS user ``JohnDoe`` the SVN user ``johnd`` whose password is ``johndpassword``, add the following:
    
        .. code-block:: xml

            <user name="JohnDoe">
                <svn name="johnd" password="johndpassword" />
            </user>

     NOTE: The ``<user name="guest">`` entry is the default SVN user credentials used by any OS user not specifically configured. If it's only you on this machine, you can just enter your svn name and password. Leave user name as ``guest``

    3. Save the ``permissions.xml``  file.


.. tip:: **To define several version control repositories:**

    1. Open the ``versioncontrol.xml``  file located in the ``Tahoma stuff\config`` folder with a text editor.

    2. Add after the lines defining a repository the following lines:
    
        .. code-block:: xml

            <repository>
                <name>PutYourRepositoryName</name>
                <localPath>putYourWorkingCopyPath</localPath>
                <repoPath>putYourRepositoryPath</repoPath>
            </repository>
 
      and set the related information.

    3. Save the ``versioncontrol.xml``  file.


.. tip:: **To define users for different repositories:**

    1. Open the ``permissions.xml``  file located in the ``Tahoma stuff\config`` folder with a text editor.

    2. In the user section assign to a user the version control user name and password as configured on the server of the second repository.
   
      For example to assign to the OS user ``JohnDoe`` the SVN user ``johnd2`` whose password is ``johndpassword2`` defined for the second repository, add a ``svn name``  line so that the ``user name``  section in the ``permissions.xml``  file will look like the following:
    
        .. code-block:: xml

            <user name="JohnDoe">
                <svn name="johnd" password="johndpassword" />
                <svn name="johnd2" password="johndpassword2" />
            </user>

    3. Save the ``permissions.xml``  file.


.. _initializing_the_version_control_in_toonz:

Initializing the Version Control in Tahoma
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Before starting to use the version control system, it has to be initialized by setting an option in the **Preferences** dialog and restarting Tahoma.

At this point the repository will be displayed in the Tahoma browser, and you will be able to start using it.

.. tip:: **To initialize the version control system:**

    1. In Tahoma open the Preferences  →  Version Control dialog and activate the **Enable Version Control** option.

     .. note:: If the version control is not correctly installed or the configuration file is not correctly defined, activating the option will prompt a warning message.

    2. Quit and restart Tahoma.

    3. In the Tahoma browser look for the repository at the end of the folder tree, named as you defined it in the configuration file; right-click it and choose **Get** from the menu that opens to establish the connection between the *central repository* and the local *working copy*.


.. _using_the_version_control_system:

Using the Version Control System
--------------------------------
The *central repository* and the local *working copy* are displayed in the Tahoma browser at the end of the folder tree as one single folder. By navigating the contents of this folder it's possible to retrieve the folders and files. 

.. figure:: ./_static/version_control/browser_tree_svn.png

   One online repository defined (**svn_test**) hosting the active project (**mySVNproject**). 

When a folder is selected in the folder tree *a refresh operation occurs automatically*, to check the status of the folder and its content. As this operations may require some time according to the connection speed on the local network or in the Internet, the automatic refresh operation can be disabled.

.. note:: If several repositories are defined, each of them will be displayed with the name previously assigned.

.. tip:: **To disable the automatic refresh for folder content:**

    1. Choose File  →  Preferences  →  Version Control.

    2. Deactivate the **Automatically Refresh Folder Contents** option.

.. tip:: **To manually refresh a folder content visualization:**

    Right-click the folder icon in the folder tree and choose **Refresh** from the menu that opens.


.. _getting_and_putting_folders_and_files:

Getting and Putting Folders and Files
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
The basic operations in the version control system involves *getting* files from the central repository to the local working copy; and then *putting* the modified files back from the local *working copy* to the *central repository*.

|put|

In case you are *putting* folders, in the dialog that opens you can check which files and folders contained in the selected folder have to be put in the central repository. Every time files and folders are put, it is also possible to type a *comment* to let the other users know about s of the performed modifications.

|put_scene|

In case you are *getting* or *putting* scene files (TNZ format), in the dialog that opens it's possible to check the **Get Scene Contents** or the **Put Scene Contents** option to include with the request, or return back, the materials used in the scene as well.

.. note:: The first time you *get* a folder not previously available in the *working copy* (folder with grey icon), you get the files contained in the folder, but not the sub-folders. The next time you *get* the folder (folder with a colored icon), you get the entire contents of the folder, including sub-folders and the related contents.

.. tip:: **To get the latest version of a folder or a file from the central repository to the local working copy:**

    1. Right-click the folder icon in the folder tree, or the file icon in the browser, and choose **Get** from the menu that opens.

    2. In the dialog that opens if you are getting a scene file (TNZ format) activate the **Get Scene Contents** if you want to get the files used in the scene as well.

    3. Click the **Update** button.

.. tip:: **To put your modified version of a folder or a file from the local working copy to the central repository:**

    1. Right-click the folder icon in the folder tree, or the file icon in the browser, and choose **Put** from the menu that opens.
    
    2. In the dialog that opens do any of the following:

     - If you are putting a folder, check which files and folders contained by the selected folder have to be put in the central repository.

     - If you are putting a scene file (TNZ format) activate the **Put Scene Contents** if you want to put the files used in the scene as well.

    3. Type a comment if required and click the **Put** button.


.. _editing_files:

Editing Files
'''''''''''''
When using the version control system, in order to modify files you have to put them in **Edit** mode *before loading them* into Tahoma; if not, they will be loaded as *read-only*.

|edit|

The **Edit** operation "locks" the file, so only the user running the command will be able to modify it (preventing other users using the same *central repository* from unlocking it and being able to modify it). At the moment a file is about to be edited, it's possible to type in a *Comment*, to let the other users know about your editing operation.

|edit_scene|

When editing a scene file (TNZ format), in the dialog that opens it's possible to check the **Edit Scene Contents** option, in order to be able to edit the materials used in the scene as well. If you choose to edit only the scene file, or if some material used in the scene is currently being edited by other users sharing the same central repository, the locked frames of that levels will be displayed with a forbidden icon in the Level Strip.

|edit_frame_range|

The **Edit Frame Range** command is available as well, to let a user edit only the *needed frames* of any Vector or Smart Raster animation level. This way, different users can work at the same time *on different frame ranges* of the same animation level.

|unlock|

When you want to release files from the *editing mode*, so that others can work on them, you can use the **Unlock** command.

.. note:: Files are in read-only mode (or in locked mode) in case a user is *editing* them, by setting the file system read-only attribute. For this reason, manually using the OS (instead of the appropriate version control commands) to change this status, may cause serious inconsistencies in the version control system.

.. tip:: **To edit an updated file:**

    1. Right-click the file and choose **Edit** from the menu that opens.

    2. In the dialog that opens if you are editing a scene file (TNZ format) activate the **Edit Scene Contents** if you want to edit the files used in the scene as well.

    3. Type a comment if required and click the **Edit** button.

.. tip:: **To edit a file that is older than the version available in the central repository:**

    1. Right-click the file and choose **Edit** from the menu that opens.

    2. In the dialog that opens if you are editing a scene file (TNZ format) activate the **Edit Scene Contents** if you want to edit the files used in the scene as well.

    3. Type a comment if required and do one of the following:

     - Click the **Get and Edit** button to get the latest version of the files and edit them.

     - Click the **Edit** button to edit the version of the files that is currently in your local working copy.

.. tip:: **To edit only the needed frames of a Toonz level file:**

    1. Right-click the file and choose **Edit Frame Range** from the menu that opens.

    2. In the dialog that opens set the frame range you want to edit.

    3. Type a comment if required and click the **Edit** button.

.. tip:: **To release a file from the editing mode:**

    Right-click the file and choose **Unlock** from the menu that opens.

.. tip:: **To check the editing state of a locked file:**

    Right-click the file and choose **Edit Info** from the menu that opens.


.. _retrieving_file_revisions:

Retrieving File Revisions
'''''''''''''''''''''''''
One of the main advantages of using a version control system is that the *history* of the revisions for every file in the production database is always available. This means that it's possible to very easily retrieve previous versions of any file.

To retrieve older file versions it's possible to use the **Get Revision** command. When used on a single file it displays a timeline with all the file versions; in the timeline you can check the different file versions with the related icons and information, and select which version to get in order to edit it.

|get_revision|

When getting a revision of a scene file (TNZ format), in the dialog that opens it's possible to check the **Get Scene Contents** option in order to get the revisions of the materials used in the scene as well.

|get_revision_multiple_files|

When used on a multiple files selection it opens a dialog that allows you to specify the time, day, week or date of the files version you want to retrieve.

.. tip:: **To retrieve an older revision of a file:**

    1. Right-click the file and choose **Get Revision** from the menu that opens.

    2. In the dialog that opens look for the file version you are interested in and select it; if you are editing a scene file (TNZ format) activate the **Edit Scene Contents** if you want to get the revision of the files used in the scene as well.

    3. Do one of the following:

     - Click the **Get Selected Revision** button to get the selected file version.

     - Click the **Get Last Revision** button to get the latest file version.

.. tip:: **To retrieve an older revision of a selection of multiple files:**

    1. Right-click any of the selected files and choose **Get Revision** from the menu that opens.
    
    2. In the dialog that opens specify how much older the version of the files you want to retrieve has to be, by doing one of the following:

     - Specify a *time* in hours and minutes.

     - Specify a number of *days*.

     - Specify a number of *weeks*.

     - Specify and exact *date and time*.

    3. Click the **Update** button.


.. _understanding_the_folder_and_file_icons:

Understanding the Folder and File Icons
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
According to the folder and file icons you can tell if the folder or the file in the working copy is updated or not to the latest version available in the central repository, and if files are edited by other users and locked.

.. note:: If the File Browser displays files as a List, the information about the version control status is displayed in the column labeled *Version Control*.

For **folders** the following icons are used:

- |grey_folder| A *grey* folder icon is used for folders available only in the *repository*. You can use the **Get** command to copy them to the local *working copy*.

- |colored_folder_with_yellow_mark| A colored folder icon with a *yellow mark* is used when the folder contents in the *working copy* is not up to date and does not match to the folder contents in the *repository*: this is the case when there are modified or new files in the *working copy* or there are modified or new files in the *repository*. You can use the **Get** command to copy them to the local *working copy*.

- |colored_folder_with_green_mark| A colored folder icon with a *green mark* is used when the folder contents in the *working copy* is up to date and matches to the folder contents in the *repository*.

- |colored_folder_with_plus_mark| A colored folder with a *plus mark* is used for folders available only in the *working copy*. You can use the **Put** command to copy them to the *central repository*.


For **files** the following icons are used:

- A generic *grey* icon is used for files available only in the *repository*. You can use the **Get** command to copy them to the local *working copy*.

- |grey_mark_check| The file icon with a *grey check mark* is used when files in the *working copy* are up to date and match to the latest version available in the *repository*. The files are in *read-only mode*, and they have to be in *edit mode* in order to be modified.

- |green_mark_check| The file icon with a *green check mark* is used when files in the *working copy* are in *edit mode*.

- |half_grey_mark_check| The file icon with a *green check mark on a grey and white background* is used when files in the *working copy* are partially in *edit mode*.

- |red_exclamation_mark_check| The file icon with a *red exclamation mark* is used when files in the *working copy* are newer than the latest version available in the *repository*, because you modified them. You can use the **Put** command to copy them to the *central repository*.

- |half_grey_red_exclamation_mark_check| The file icon with a *red exclamation mark on a grey and white background* is used when files in the *working copy* are partially newer than to the latest version available in the *repository*, because you modified them. You can use the **Put** command to copy them to the *central repository*.

- |orange_exclamation_mark_check| The file icon with an *orange exclamation mark* is used when files in the *working copy* are older than the latest version available in the *repository*, because someone modified them. You can use the **Get** command to copy them to the *local working copy*.

- |lock_mark| The file icon with an *lock mark* is used when files are in *edit mode* by other users. For these files it is only possible to check the information about the user editing the file. 

- |half_grey_lock_mark| The file icon with a *lock mark on a grey and white background* is used when files are *partially in edit mode* by other users. 

- |blue_plus_mark| The file icon with the *plus mark* is used for files available only in the *working copy*. You can use the **Put** command to copy them to the *central repository*.
