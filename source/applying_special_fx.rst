Applying Effects
================
Effects can be applied to animation levels, images and clips exposed in Xsheet columns (or Timeline layers) in the **FX Schematic**, where each element is represented as a node.

The relationship between the contents of columns/layers and effects can be managed by connecting or disconnecting links between nodes.

.. _using_the_fx_schematic:

Using the FX Schematic
----------------------
In the FX schematic all columns/layers are displayed as nodes having an output port connected to the Xsheet node: this means that their content is part of the scene and is rendered as it is.

When effects are added, they are displayed as nodes as well, with ports to create links that let you set the way the effect modify the scene contents. 

Column/layer nodes have the **Camera Stand** (|camera_stand|) and the **Render** (|preview|) toggles on the top right: these toggles are the same as the toggles available in the Xsheet column (or Timeline layer) headers (see :ref:`Working with Xsheet Columns <working_with_xsheet_columns>`  ). Effects nodes only have the **Render** toggle (|preview|) allowing you to include or exclude temporarily the effect in the rendering.

Nodes can be easily selected and arranged. When selected, nodes are highlighted in *white*; the *current* node has its label in *yellow*.

.. tip:: **To access the FX Schematic:**

    Click the Schematic toggle button (|schematic|) at the right of the bottom bar of the Schematic panel until the title bar displays **FX Schematic**.

.. tip:: **To navigate the FX Schematic:**

    Do one of the following:

    - Use the mouse wheel, or the zoom shortcut keys (by default **+** and **-** keys) to zoom in and zoom out.

    - Middle-click and drag to scroll in any direction.

    - Use the **Fit to Window** button (|fit_to_window|) in the bottom bar of the Schematic panel to display all of the nodes in the current panel.

    - Use the **Focus on Current** button (|focus_on_current|) in the bottom bar of the Schematic panel to center the Schematic on the current node.

    - Use the **Reorder Nodes** button (|reorder_nodes|) in the bottom bar of the Schematic panel to reorder all the nodes.

    - Use the **Reset Size** button (|reset|) in the bottom bar of the Schematic panel, or use the **Reset View** shortcut (by default the **Alt + 0** key) to display all of the nodes at the default size.

.. tip:: **To rename a node:**

.. _grouping_nodes:

Grouping Nodes
''''''''''''''
It's possible to group several nodes into one single node, in order to better manage the whole FX Schematic. Groups can be opened to be examined and edited, and its components can be selected for further operations, like editing effect settings, or creating new groups.

.. tip:: **To Group selected nodes:**

    Do one of the following:

    - Right-click any selected node and choose **Group** from the menu that opens.
    
    - Press the **Ctrl-G** (PC) or **Cmd-G** (macOS) shortcut.

.. tip:: **To open a Group:**

    Right-click the group and choose **Open Group** from the menu that opens: the group nodes are displayed in a box, showing links between group nodes, and links with nodes outside of the group. 

    .. note:: In the FX Schematic, when the content of a group is displayed, it's possible to edit the links between Group nodes and links with nodes outside of the group.

.. tip:: **To release a Group:**

    Right-click the Group and choose **Ungroup** from the menu that opens, or press the shortcut **Ctrl-Shift-G** (PC) or **Cmd-Shift-G** (macOS).


.. _inserting_special_fx:

Inserting Effects
'''''''''''''''''
You can **Insert** effects to selected nodes, **Add** effects to the Schematic, or **Replace** previously added effect nodes. This can be done from the **FX Browser** panel or by using the drop-down menu that opens when right-clicking nodes or an empty area of the FX Schematic. Both are organized in folders/submenus containing sets of effects; if some *Presets* are defined for an effect, an additional folder/submenu is available (see  :ref:`Creating Presets <creating_presets>`  ).

 |FX_Browser| 

When *inserting* effects, they will be placed along the link that starts from the selected node output port; when *adding* effects, they will be placed at the end of a new link that will start from the selected node output port.

In case several nodes are selected, the effect will be added/inserted for *each* selected node, but all the added/inserted effects will be *Linked*, and connected visually by a *green* line. This means that every time the effect is edited, all the linked nodes will be edited as well, unless you break the link to start editing them separately.

To globally apply effects it's possible to use the **Xsheet** node as if it were a standard column node (representing the whole content of the scene) and inserting effects from there.

Three different types of effects can be used in the Schematic, each with a different type of node:

- **Basic effects**, such as the Blur effect, that simply modify the contents of a column; they are displayed as a blue node with an input port on the left, labelled *Source*, and an output port on the right. 

 |Basic_FX_Example| 

To affect a column/layer, they have to be inserted in the link from the column/layer node to the Xsheet node, so that the column/layer node is connected to the effect input port, and the effect node output port is connected to the Xsheet node. 

If several effects are applied in a chain, they will be applied one after the other, following the order from the column/layer node to the Xsheet node.

- **Combined effects**, such as the Matte In effect, that modify the column/layer contents according to the contents other columns/layers; they are displayed with a pink colored node with two or more input ports on the left, and one output port on the right. 

To affect a column/layer, they have to be inserted into the link from the column/layer node to the Xsheet node, so that the column/layer node is connected to the first effect input port labelled *Source*, while the other columns/layers are connected to the other input ports, whose labels depend on the effect; the effect node output port has to be connected to the Xsheet node. 

 |Combined_FX_Example| 

For example in case of a Matte In effect, the column to be matted has to be linked to the *Source* input port, the matte column has to be linked to the *Matte* input port, and the output port has to be connected to the Xsheet node.

- **Effects that create computer generated images**, such as the Radial Gradient, that are exposed in Xsheet columns (and Timeline layers) and therefore are similar to columns; they are displayed with a brown node with only an output port on the right. These effect nodes have to be connected to the Xsheet node to be rendered, or can be connected to other effect nodes.

.. _editing_the_fx_schematic:

Editing the FX Schematic
''''''''''''''''''''''''
Links between nodes have to be considered like flows going to the right, from the column/layer nodes to the *Output* node, via the Xsheet node. If along the way there is one or several effects, the column content will be consequently processed before becoming part of the output. 

From the nodes output port several links can start at the same time, thus allowing, for example, a column/layer to be rendered as it is, and to be also used as a mask for another column/layer. It is also possible to determine permanently whether columns/layers will be rendered or not, by leaving or deleting the link to the Xsheet node.

By editing the links between nodes, or by creating new ones, you can control how column/layer nodes will interact with each other and with effects before being rendered. 

.. note:: In the effects that accept multiple input nodes it is possible to change the stacking order of the input nodes by clicking and dragging in the *ports* area.

Effect nodes and links can be selected in order to be cut, copied, pasted or deleted. When selected, nodes and links are highlighted in white; the current node has its label in yellow; when at least one object is selected, the related links are displayed in blue.

When pasting a copied/cut selection, several options are available:

- Use **Paste** to paste the copied/cut selection into the FX Schematic.

- Use **Paste Insert** to insert the pasted selection into the *selected links*.

- Use **Paste Add** to add the pasted selection from the *selected nodes* at the end of new links. 

- Use **Paste Replace** to replace *selected effects nodes* with the pasted selection.

.. _using_multiple_output_nodes:

Using Multiple Output Nodes
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
In the FX Schematic by default the Xsheet node is connected to an Output node: this means that all the nodes connected to the Xsheet node will be rendered both in the preview and in the final rendering.

The scene rendering can be limited to a specific node of the schematic by creating additional Output nodes, connected to the node where you want to limit the rendering. 

When more than one Output node is defined, you can set which is the *active* one (the one that will be considered for previewing or rendering the scene); the active output node is displayed in *blue*, while the others in a *dull cyan*. 

.. tip:: **To limit the output to a specific node:**

    1. Select the node to which you want to limit the output.

    2. Do one of the following:

    - Click the **New Output** button (|output|) in the bottom bar of the schematic panel.

.. _editing_fx_settings:

Editing Effects Settings
------------------------
Effects parameters and their animation can be controlled in the **FX Settings** panel. According to the selected effect, it displays a different layout of sliders, check boxes, text fields, etc.

At the bottom of the panel a *preview area* is available to check the result of the applied effect: you can expand it or contract it, activate it or deactivate it, navigate its content, set its size, its background color, and limit it to the camera shot.
The preview area can be expanded or contracted by clicking on the **+**/**-** symbol to the left of the **Swatch Viewer** text, at the bottom left of the FX Settings panel.

Parameters can be animated by setting keyframes at specific frames. A **Set Key** button (|key|) is available in the preview area, at the bottom bar of the panel, to set keyframes for *all* of the parameters. For each of the parameters that can be animated there is also a specific **Set Key** button (|key|) to the right of the parameter name, in order to set keyframes for each parameter independently. 

The **Set Key** button (|key|) may have the following colors:

    - It is **grey** when no keyframes for any parameter is defined at the current frame.

    - It is **half-orange** when keyframes are defined at least for one parameter.

    - It is **orange** when keyframes are defined for all the parameters.

The parameter specific **Set Key** button (|key|) may have the following colors:

    - It is **grey** if no key value is defined for the parameter at the current frame.

    - It is **orange** when a key value is defined for the parameter at the current frame.

    - It is **dull brown** if the parameter is animated but no key value is defined at the current frame.

    - It is **dull yellow with a circle in center** if you changed the parameter value and the current frame does not have a key for the parameter.

Frames and keyframes can be navigated by using the related buttons in the bottom bar of the panel. The **Next Key** (|next_key|) and **Previous Key** buttons (|prevkey|) are available only if more than one keyframe is defined.

.. _using_fx_gadgets:

Using Effects Gadgets
'''''''''''''''''''''
Some effects parameters related to positions or dimensions have some gadgets available in the Viewer in order to be set by using the camera box and the scene elements as a reference. For example the Radial Gradient effect has two circular gadgets that can be edited to set the inner size and the outer size of the gradient.

As soon as an effect node is selected in the schematic, the **Animate** tool becomes the current tool and the related effect gadgets, if available, are shown. The Animate tool settings will refer to the column the effect is applied to, but in case the effect creates a computer generated image (e.g. a radial gradient or a light spot) the settings will refer to the effect column itself (see  :ref:`Animating Objects <animating_objects>`  ).

.. tip:: **To visualize effects gadgets in the Viewer:**

    Select the effect node in the FX Schematic.

.. tip:: **To edit effects gadgets:**

    Click and drag the effects gadgets visible in the Viewer. As you roll over the gadget and the related handles, the cursor changes shape to indicate you are editing an effect gadget. 

.. note:: Some gadgets have a handle for reference; however any point along the gadget shape can be clicked and dragged.


.. _defining_colors_and_color_spectrums:

Defining Colors and Color Spectrums
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Some effects may require the definition of a color, or a color spectrum.

Colors can be defined by editing the related Red, Green, Blue and Alpha values, or by using the Style Editor. 

 |Defining_Colors_Example| 

Color spectrums, i.e. a series of colors defining a continuous gradient, can be defined by adding any color you need, and editing each color separately. The color in the spectrum can be moved to set the distance between two colors and the related gradient.

.. tip:: **To define a color:**

    Do one of the following:

    - Set the Red, Green, Blue and Alpha values.

    - Click the color thumbnail and use the Style Editor to edit it (see  :ref:`Plain Colors <plain_colors>`  ).

.. tip:: **To set a color of the spectrum:**

    Select the arrow below the spectrum identifying the color, and edit the related color.

.. tip:: **To add a color to the spectrum:**

    Click the spectrum where you want to add the new color.

.. tip:: **To move a color in the spectrum:**

    Click and drag the arrow identifying the color to a new position.

.. tip:: **To remove a color from the spectrum:**

    Click and drag the arrow identifying the color *down*.


.. _creating_presets:

Creating Presets
----------------
A particular configuration and animation of an effect parameters can be saved as a **Preset** to be available later on, both in the FX Browser and the drop-down menus that open when right-clicking nodes or in the Schematic area.

When a preset for a particular effect is saved, in the FX Browser the effect icon turns into a folder containing the saved preset, with the folder icon still selectable to insert the effect with its default values; in the drop-down menus the effect has an additional drop down menu where the first item can be selected to insert the effect with its default values.

 |Creating_Presets_Example| 

Presets are saved in the ``<projectroot>\fxs\preset`` folder. This allow the presets to be available on all the computers sharing the same *Projectroot*.

.. note:: Currently the statement above if not true, as by default presets are being saved in ``Tahoma stuff\fxs\presets``. On Windows it can be changed to any other path by going to the registry and changing the ``System\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Tahoma\Tahoma\TOONZFXPRESETS`` key to the desired location.

Once a preset is applied there is no link between the *saved preset* and the *applied preset*: the applied preset can be edited without affecting the saved one.

.. note:: When you save a preset with a name already used, a confirmation dialog will open, asking you whether you want to overwrite the previously saved preset.

.. tip:: **To save a preset:**

    1. Right-click the effect node you want to save as a preset and choose **Save As Preset** from the menu that opens.

    2. Assign a name to the preset and click the **Save** button.

.. tip:: **To retrieve a saved preset:**

    Do any of the following:

    - Open the **FX Browser** and open the folder related to the effect for which you saved the preset.

    - In the right-click menus **Insert FX**, **Add FX** or **Replace FX**, choose the sub-menu related to the effect for which you saved the preset.

- **Width**, **Height**, define the dimension of the text box. Just like in the Text items of the Clapperboard feature, the font size will be automatically adjusted in order to fit the box (see  :ref:`Using The Clapperboard <using_the_clapperboard>` ).

- **Font**, specifies the font family to use.

- **Style:**, specifies the font style to use.

- **Size:**, specifies the *maximum* font size to use.

 .. note:: The **Size** value will only take effect if the *automatically-calculated font size* (in order to fit the specified text box) is bigger than the value specified for this parameter.

- **Text Color**, specifies the color of the text. This color will also be used for the border line.

- **Box Color**, specifies the background color of the text box.

- **Show Border**, when activated, a border line will be rendered around the *text bounding box*. Please note that the *text box* (specified by the user) and the *text bounding box* (automatically computed from the rendered text) may become different, especially when the maximum font **Size** parameter is set to a small value.

.. note:: Known Issue: When you are using a Note Level column for the source text, a change in the note text will not automatically trigger the preview regeneration. You will need to manually regenerate the preview using the context menu of the Viewer.

Stylize
'''''''

.. _color_emboss:

Color Emboss
~~~~~~~~~~~~
 |Color_Emboss| 

Traces the edges of the Source content with a combination of highlights and shadows. You can set the Intensity of the effect, and the Distance and Direction of the light that create the emboss effect. The Radius sets the depth of the embossing.

By connecting a node to the Controller port, the Source content will be embossed according to the Controller node content.

.. _emboss:

Emboss
~~~~~~
 |Emboss| 

Turns the Source content to grey areas and traces its edges with a combination of highlights and shadows. You can set the Intensity of the effect, and the Distance and Direction of the light that create the emboss effect. The Radius sets the depth of the embossing.

.. _mosaic:

Mosaic
~~~~~~
 |Mosaic| 

Turns the Source content in a series of tiles according to the specified Size and Distance. The color and transparency of the tiles are sampled from the source content. 

A Background Color can be set, and will be visible around the tiles. The tile shape can be chosen between Square and Round.

.. _posterize:

Posterize
~~~~~~~~~
 |Posterize| 

Converts the Source content into a number of shades according to the set number of Levels. The shades depends on the brightness values of the source content and the levels are intended for each channel; for example, two levels produces six colors: two for the red, two for the green, and two for the blue.

.. _solarize:

Solarize
~~~~~~~~
 |Solarize| 

Blends a negative and a positive version of the Source content, as if exposing a photographic print briefly to light during development. You can set the Intensity of the effect and control the Peak Edge, that is the amount of positive and negative image that is used in the blend.


.. _toonz_level:

Tahoma Level
''''''''''''
Tahoma Level type of effects can be applied only to Vector and Smart Raster (PLI and TLV files). They usually affect the drawings they are applied to according to Style indexes. Style indexes can be retrieved in the Palette after the # symbol in the Style tooltip, or in the *bottom right corner* of the style in any of the **Thumbnails View** modes. 

Index numbers can be specified in the related text field, separated by a comma. To define a range of indexes, you should type the first and last separated by a dash (e.g. 4-7 will refer to indexes 4, 5, 6 and 7). To select all indexes, type ``all`` ; to select no index, type ``none`` .

Tahoma Level type of effects have to be always applied first when a series of effects are applied to an animation level, as they work only on Vector or Smart Raster levels that have not been transformed by other type of effects. However two or more Tahoma Level type of effects can be applied to the same animation level.

.. _art_contour:

Art Contour
~~~~~~~~~~~
 |Art_Contour| 

Creates in the Source content a pattern, by repeating the Controller node content, along lines painted with styles whose indexes are specified in the Color Indexes text field. It can be used for example to create scattered brush, or hair and fur effects along drawing lines.

The Keep Color option assigns the color of the line to the applied pattern; while the Keep Contour option retains the drawing line that will be visible beneath the pattern.

The way the contents of the Controller node create the pattern depends on the Pattern settings. 

The Density sets the amount of pattern to be applied along the line. By setting the Density to 0, you can specify a Minimum and Maximum Distance between two subsequent images applied as pattern on the line.

The Size sets the Minimum and Maximum resizing percentage applied to the images used as the pattern; the value 100 is the original size of the images.

The Orientation sets the Minimum and Maximum rotation angle for the images used as the pattern, according to the line direction; the value 0 display the images perpendicular to the line direction. If the Absolute Orientation option is used, the orientation values do not depend on the direction of the lines: the value 0 is the original images orientation.

.. _calligraphic_line:

Calligraphic Line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 |Calligraphic_Line| 

Changes in the Source content the thickness of the drawing lines painted with styles whose indexes are specified in the Color Indexes text field. 

You can specify the Thickness increase and how it is applied, as a percentage, to the different line directions Horizontal, Vertical, Up Diagonal, Down Diagonal.

The Smoothness sets the smoothness of the passage between sections of the lines affected by the effect, and those not affected; while the Noise sets the regularity of the edge of the line.

.. _color_blending:

Color Blending
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 |Color_Blending| 

Blends in the Source content lines and areas painted with styles whose indexes are specified in the Color Indexes text field. It can be used for example to blend shadow and highlight areas with the plain colored area, or to create gradients of colors.

The Intensity sets how wide the blended area between the selected colors will be; while the Smoothness sets how smooth the dithering between blended colors is.

The No Blending over Other Colors option stops the blending as soon as a line, or an area, whose index is not included in the selection, is detected; if deactivated, the blending between selected colors continues under excluded lines and areas.

.. _external_palette:

External Palette
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 |External_Palette| 

Applies to the Source content the palette node connected to the Palette input port; if a column node is connected to the Palette input port, the palette related to its content will be considered. 

The original styles of the Tahoma levels contained in the source node are replaced with those of the levels contained in the palette node according to their style indexes.

.. _outline:

Outline
~~~~~~~
 |Outline| 

Changes in the Source content the thickness of the drawing external outline. 

You can specify the Thickness increase and how it is applied, as a percentage, to the different line directions Horizontal, Vertical, Up Diagonal, Down Diagonal.

The Smoothness sets the smoothness of the passage between sections of the lines affected by the effect, and those not affected; while the Noise sets the regularity of the edge of the outline.

.. _palette_filter:

Palette Filter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 |Palette_Filter| 

Filters the styles of the Source content palette according to the indexes specified in the Color Indexes text field.

The Apply To option menu lets you choose if you want to affect Lines & Area, only Lines or only Areas, even if painted with the same styles; the Action option menu lets you choose if you want to keep or remove the specified styles. 

.. _pinned_texture:

Pinned Texture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 |Pinned_Texture| |Pinned_Texture_2| 

Distorts the Texture node content and applies it to the Source content areas that are painted with styles whose indexes are specified in the Color Indexes text field.

The distortion can be done like in the Free Distort effect (see  :ref:`Free Distort <free_distort>`  ) and the texture can be applied like in the Texture effect (see below).

.. _texture:

Texture
~~~~~~~
 |Texture| 

Applies the Texture node content to the Source content lines and areas that are painted with styles whose indexes are specified in the Color Indexes text field.

As the texture node content can be animated as you like, this effect allows you to generate animated texture as well.

The Action option menu lets you choose if you want to apply the texture to the specified styles (Keep) or to apply it to all styles except for the specified ones (Delete). 

The Mode option menu lets you set how the texture node content will be applied: Texture uses the texture to replace selected styles; Pattern preserves the original colors but varies them according to the texture brightness; Add, Subtract, Multiply, Lighten and Darken defines the way the texture is applied to the original colors (see  :ref:`Layer Blending <layer_blending>`  ). In case the Add, Subtract or Multiply mode are selected, you can also set the Value of the effect.

.. note:: To repeat the texture image and tile it to create a larger texture, you can apply the Tile effect to the texture column before linking it to the Texture node (see  :ref:`Tile <tile>`  ).


.. _shaders:

Shaders
'''''''
Tahoma enables support for effects rendered through hardware-accelerated pixelshaders. Shaders are simple programs compiled by a graphics processing unit that harness the massively parallel architecture of modern graphics devices, to execute with extreme speed. Tahoma's shader effects are written in the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL), and are located in ``Tahoma stuff/library/shaders``. Refer to the readme.txt file there for further details on editing or creating new shader effects as well as read :ref:`GLSL_SHADERS_INTRO`.

 |Caustic| 

Creates a new column/layer containing a simulation of the reflection of light on a water surface. Sets the color of the water defining the RGBA values of the Water Color parameter. 

The stage of the displacement map image can be controlled by using the Evolution value; by setting the variation of this value between two keys, you set how much the displacement map image changes during the animation.

.. _fireball:

Fireball
~~~~~~~~
 |Fireball| 

Creates a new column/layer containing a ball of flames erupting from a point.

A range of colors can be defined setting the RGBA values of color 1 and color 2. The stage of the displacement map image can be controlled by using the Evolution value; by setting the variation of this value between two keys, you set how much the displacement map image changes during the animation.

.. _glitter:

Glitter
~~~~~~~
 |Glitter| 

Adds cross-shaped light rays extending from the brightest part of an image.

Use Threshold to specify the cut-out on the input image's brightest part. Higher values will make the fx add lights also to darker image parts, producing more lights. The Brightness specifies the brightness of added light rays; the Radius specify how much the light rays will extend from bright input pixels; the Angle specify the angle of light crosses. A value 0 means that produced light crosses will be axis-aligned. Halo is the amount of light disperion orthogonal to the direction of light rays. Higher values will produce broader rays.

.. _star_sky:

Star Sky
~~~~~~~~
 |Star_Sky| 

Creates a new column/layer containing a simple star field with variable brightness with overlayed clouds. Sets the color of the overlayed clouds defining the RGBA values of the Cloud Color parameter.
